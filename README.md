**Project Description: Analysis on the World Happiness Report 2024**

**Overview**

This project aims to conduct a detailed correlation analysis of the data provided in the World Happiness Report 2024. The report typically ranks countries worldwide based on various determinants of happiness such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The goal of this analysis is to identify and understand the relationships between these factors and overall happiness scores to determine which variables most significantly impact happiness across different nations. We also tested alternative hypotheses on Happiness Score including the affect of income inequality, population, and age.

**Objectives**

1. **Data Acquisition:** Obtain the latest World Happiness Report dataset, ensuring it includes variables like happiness score, GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perception of corruption.
1. **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, ensuring correct data types, and verifying data integrity.
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform initial investigations on the data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using statistical summaries and graphical representations.
1. **Correlation Analysis:** Employ statistical methods to compute the correlation coefficients between the happiness score and each independent variable to identify strong predictors of happiness.
1. **Visualization:** Create visualizations such as heatmaps and scatter plots to clearly illustrate the strength and nature of relationships between variables.
1. **Interpretation and Reporting:** Interpret the results of the correlation analysis, discussing the implications of strong and weak relationships found among the variables. Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the findings and recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders interested in enhancing national happiness levels.

**Tools and Technologies**

- **Data Processing and Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), R
- **Statistical Analysis:** Python (SciPy)
- **Visualization:** Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Document Preparation:** Jupyter Notebook, Python


**Expected Outcomes**

- Identify key predictors of happiness among the factors provided in the World Happiness Report.
- Understand the influence of economic, social, and political environments on national happiness levels.
- Provide actionable insights that can guide policymakers in crafting strategies aimed at improving the well-being of their citizens.

**Potential Challenges**

- Dealing with incomplete or noisy data that could affect the accuracy of the correlation analysis.
- Interpretation of correlation values, especially in distinguishing between causation and mere association.

This project not only contributes to academic discussions around subjective well-being and its drivers but also provides practical insights that could influence policy decisions aiming at enhancing happiness and quality of life worldwide.
